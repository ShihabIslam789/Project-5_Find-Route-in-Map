# what is a Stack
 Stacks are a linear data structure which emphasis a order of operations are performed. the order of actions are Last in and First out. <br>

# Project Premise

Using the Stack we must get from one point on a map to another without violating the pathways or roads that connect from one point to another on the roadmap.
